<h1>Assignemnt 4 Algorithms</h1>

<p>in this project we have made the assigned algorithms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DepthFirstSearch</li>
  <li>BreadthFirstSearch</li>
  <li>Dijkstra with distance</li>
  <li>Dijkstra with time</li>
  <li>Minimum spanning tree</li>
</ul>

<p>to run the project, open it in your favorite id√© (we used netbeans), and then outcomment the 
algorithm you wish to see in action from the main class.</p>

<p>when compared to the datastructures mentioned in the book, we would say that our way of searching through the list
mostly reminds of </p>

<p>we have chosen "some_symbol_table" and we mostly we have the complexity of  O(n^2)
  
  <p>the other data structures were half of half (both slow and large)</p>
  
  <p>we believe that if we had used adjacency matrix, the size in bytes would be double</p>
